## Custom Trigger Button

Instead of the default floating button, you can use your own button to open the widget:

```html
<!-- Your custom button -->
<button id="feedback-button">Give Feedback</button>

<script>
  window.thoughtbase.initWidget({
    organizationId: 'your-organization-id-here',
    selector: '#feedback-button'  // CSS selector for your button
  });
</script>
```

When users click your button, the widget will open. The default floating button won't appear when using a custom selector.

## Styling

### Style Isolation

- The widget's styles are in a shadow DOM, isolated from your website
- Your website's styles won't affect the widget and vice versa
