## Custom Trigger Button

Instead of the default floating button, you can use your own button to open the widget:

```html
<!-- Your custom button -->
<button id="feedback-button">Give Feedback</button>

<script>
  window.initFeedbackWidget({
    organizationId: 'your-organization-id-here',
    selector: '#feedback-button'  // CSS selector for your button
  });
</script>
```

When users click your button, the widget will open. The default floating button won't appear when using a custom selector.

## Styling

The widget uses Shadow DOM to prevent style conflicts with your website. It will automatically match your site's appearance while maintaining its own styling.

### Style Isolation

- The widget's styles are isolated from your website
- Your website's styles won't affect the widget
- The widget maintains consistent appearance across different sites

## Widget Behavior

### Default Behavior

- The widget appears as a floating button in the bottom-right corner
- Clicking the button opens a modal overlay with the widget
- Users can switch between Feedback, Roadmap, and Updates tabs
- The widget closes when clicking outside or using the close button

### With Custom Selector

- The default floating button is hidden
- Only your custom button triggers the widget
- All other behavior remains the same

## Best Practices

### Placement

- Place the widget on pages where users are most likely to have feedback
- Consider using a custom button that matches your site's design
- Don't place it where it might interfere with important content

### User Experience

- Make it easy to find (but not intrusive)
- Consider showing the widget after users have had time to use your product
- Use custom buttons that fit naturally into your design

### Performance

- Load the widget script asynchronously if possible
- Don't block page rendering
- Consider lazy-loading the widget until user interaction

## Troubleshooting

### Widget Not Appearing

1. **Check the browser console** for any JavaScript errors
2. **Verify your Organization ID** is correct
3. **Ensure the script loaded** - check the Network tab
4. **Check for ad blockers** that might block the widget

### Styling Issues

- The widget uses Shadow DOM, so it should not conflict with your styles
- If you see styling issues, check browser compatibility
- The widget adapts to different screen sizes automatically
