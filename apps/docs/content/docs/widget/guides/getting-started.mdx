## Overview

The Thoughtbase widget is an embeddable component that lets your users submit feedback, view your roadmap, and see product updates directly on your website.

## Quick Start

### Step 1: Get Your Organization ID

1. Log in to your Thoughtbase dashboard
2. Navigate to your organization settings
3. Copy your **Organization ID** (you'll need this to initialize the widget)

### Step 2: Add the Widget Script

Add this script tag to your website's HTML, typically in the `<head>` or just before the closing `</body>` tag:

```html
<script src="https://app.thoughtbase.app/widget.js"></script>
```

### Step 3: Initialize the Widget

Add this initialization code after the script tag:

```html
<script>
  window.thoughtbase.initWidget({
    organizationId: 'your-organization-id-here'
  });
</script>
```

That's it! The widget will appear as a floating button in the bottom-right corner of your website.
