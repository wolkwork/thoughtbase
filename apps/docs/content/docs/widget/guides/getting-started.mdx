## Overview

The Thoughtbase widget is an embeddable component that lets your users submit feedback, view your roadmap, and see product updates directly on your website.

## Quick Start

### Step 1: Get Your Organization ID

1. Log in to your Thoughtbase dashboard
2. Navigate to your organization settings
3. Copy your **Organization ID** (you'll need this to initialize the widget)

### Step 2: Add the Widget Script

Add this script tag to your website's HTML, typically in the `<head>` or just before the closing `</body>` tag:

```html
<script src="https://app.thoughtbase.app/widget.js"></script>
```

### Step 3: Initialize the Widget

Add this initialization code after the script tag:

```html
<script>
  window.initFeedbackWidget({
    organizationId: 'your-organization-id-here'
  });
</script>
```

That's it! The widget will appear as a floating button in the bottom-right corner of your website.

## Widget Features

The widget provides three main tabs:

### 1. Submit Feedback

Users can submit ideas and suggestions directly from your website. The feedback will appear in your Thoughtbase dashboard under Ideas.

### 2. View Roadmap

Users can see what you're working on:
- **In Progress**: Features currently being developed
- **Planned**: Features scheduled for the future

This helps set expectations and shows users that you're actively working on improvements.

### 3. View Updates

Users can browse your published changelogs to see what's new. This is a great way to keep users informed about product updates.
