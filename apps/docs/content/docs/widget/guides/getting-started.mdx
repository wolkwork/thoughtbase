## Overview

The Thoughtbase widget is an embeddable component that lets your users submit feedback, view your roadmap, and see product updates directly on your website.

## Quick Start

### Step 1: Get Your Organization Slug

1. Log in to your Thoughtbase dashboard
2. Navigate to your organization settings
3. Copy your **Organization slug** (you'll need this to initialize the widget)
4. If you are self-hosting, you will also need to get your **Convex URL**

### Step 2: Add the Widget Script

Add this script tag to your website's HTML, typically in the `<head>` or just before the closing `</body>` tag:

```html
<script src="https://app.thoughtbase.app/widget.js"></script>
```

If you are self-hosting, get the widget script from your self-hosted instance.

### Step 3: Initialize the Widget

Add this initialization code after the script tag:

```html
<script>
  window.thoughtbase.initWidget({
    organizationSlug: 'your-organization-slug',
  });
</script>
```

For SSO, pass **`ssoToken`** in the config when you have a JWT from your backend; see [SSO Integration](/widget/guides/sso-integration).

That's it! The widget will appear as a floating button in the bottom-right corner of your website.

## Next Steps

- Learn about [Customization](/widget/guides/customization) options
- Set up [SSO Integration](/widget/guides/sso-integration) and pass `ssoToken` to the widget
- Check the [API Reference](/widget/api/reference) for advanced usage
