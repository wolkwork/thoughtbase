## Overview

Thoughtbase is available in two deployment options to suit different needs:

- **Cloud** - Managed hosting at [app.thoughtbase.app](https://app.thoughtbase.app)
- **Self-hosted** - Deploy on your own infrastructure

## Cloud

The cloud version is hosted and managed by Thoughtbase. This is the easiest way to get started.

### Features

- Managed infrastructure and updates
- Automatic backups and security patches
- Subscription-based billing with flexible plans
- No server maintenance required

### Billing

Cloud deployments use subscription-based billing. You can manage your subscription and billing details from the Settings page in your dashboard.

## Self-hosted

Self-hosted deployments give you full control over your infrastructure and data.

### Features

- **All features enabled** - No subscription required, all features are available
- **Full data control** - Your data stays on your infrastructure
- **Custom configuration** - Configure to match your infrastructure needs
- **No billing management** - No subscription or payment handling needed

## Choosing the Right Option

**Choose Cloud if you:**
- Want the easiest setup with no infrastructure management
- Prefer managed updates and maintenance
- Don't have specific data residency requirements

**Choose Self-hosted if you:**
- Need full control over your data and infrastructure
- Have specific compliance or data residency requirements
- Have the resources to manage your own deployment
