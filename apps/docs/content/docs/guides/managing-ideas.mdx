You can:
- **Filter by status**: Open, In Progress, Completed, or Closed
- **Filter by board**: View ideas from specific boards
- **View details**: Click any idea to see full details, comments, and reactions

## Idea Statuses

Ideas can have different statuses:

- **Pending**: Newly submitted ideas awaiting review
- **Reviewing**: Ideas currently being reviewed
- **Planned**: Ideas scheduled for future work
- **In Progress**: Ideas currently being worked on
- **Completed**: Ideas that have been implemented
- **Closed**: Ideas that won't be pursued

## Creating Ideas

While ideas are typically submitted through the widget, you can also create them directly in the dashboard for internal tracking.

## Managing Ideas

### Updating Status

Change an idea's status as work progresses:
1. Open the idea details
2. Select the new status from the status dropdown
3. The idea will move to the appropriate section

The idea detail page shows the status dropdown in the right sidebar, where you can update the status.

### Adding Comments

Discuss ideas with your team:
1. Open the idea
2. Scroll to the comments section
3. Type your comment and submit

The comments section is located in the main content area, with a text input at the top for writing new comments.

### Reacting to Ideas

Use reactions to show support for ideas:
- Click the reaction button on any idea
- Reactions help prioritize what users want most

### Linking to Changelogs

When an idea is completed:
1. Create a changelog entry
2. Link the completed idea to the changelog
3. This shows users that their feedback was implemented

## Organizing Ideas

### Using Boards

Boards help categorize ideas by feature area or product line:
- Create boards for different product areas
- Filter ideas by board to focus on specific areas
- Organize your roadmap by board

### Best Practices

- **Regularly review**: Set aside time to review new ideas
- **Update statuses**: Keep statuses current to reflect reality
- **Close ideas**: Close ideas that won't be pursued to keep your board clean
- **Use reactions**: Pay attention to reaction counts to understand priorities

## Tips & Tricks

1. **Bulk Actions**: Select multiple ideas to update their status at once
2. **Search**: Use the search functionality to quickly find specific ideas
3. **Filtering**: Combine status and board filters to focus on specific subsets
4. **Notifications**: Enable notifications to stay updated on new feedback
