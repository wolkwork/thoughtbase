## Viewing Ideas

Navigate to **Ideas** in the sidebar to see all feedback and ideas submitted for your organization.

You can:
- **Filter by status**: Open, In Progress, Completed, or Closed
- **Filter by board**: View ideas from specific boards
- **View details**: Click any idea to see full details, comments, and reactions

## Idea Statuses

Ideas can have different statuses:

- **Open**: Newly submitted ideas awaiting review
- **In Progress**: Ideas currently being worked on
- **Completed**: Ideas that have been implemented
- **Closed**: Ideas that won't be pursued

## Creating Ideas

While ideas are typically submitted through the widget, you can also create them directly in the dashboard for internal tracking.

## Managing Ideas

### Updating Status

Change an idea's status as work progresses:
1. Open the idea details
2. Select the new status from the status dropdown
3. The idea will move to the appropriate section

### Adding Comments

Discuss ideas with your team:
1. Open the idea
2. Scroll to the comments section
3. Type your comment and submit

### Reacting to Ideas

Use reactions to show support for ideas:
- Click the reaction button on any idea
- Reactions help prioritize what users want most

### Linking to Changelogs

When an idea is completed:
1. Create a changelog entry
2. Link the completed idea to the changelog
3. This shows users that their feedback was implemented

## Organizing Ideas

### Using Boards

Boards help categorize ideas by feature area or product line:
- Create boards for different product areas
- Filter ideas by board to focus on specific areas
- Organize your roadmap by board

### Best Practices

- **Regularly review**: Set aside time to review new ideas
- **Update statuses**: Keep statuses current to reflect reality
- **Close ideas**: Close ideas that won't be pursued to keep your board clean
- **Use reactions**: Pay attention to reaction counts to understand priorities

## Tips & Tricks

1. **Bulk Actions**: Select multiple ideas to update their status at once
2. **Search**: Use the search functionality to quickly find specific ideas
3. **Filtering**: Combine status and board filters to focus on specific subsets
4. **Notifications**: Enable notifications to stay updated on new feedback
