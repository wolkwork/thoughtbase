## Accessing Settings

Go to **Settings** in the sidebar to configure your organization. Settings are organized into tabs:

## SSO (Single Sign-On)

Configure SSO to allow users from your external application to authenticate with the widget.

### Setting Up SSO

1. Go to **Settings** → **SSO** tab
2. Generate or view your SSO secret
3. Use this secret to sign JWTs in your application
4. Users can then authenticate using the widget with SSO tokens

### SSO Secret

- **Generate**: Create a new secret if you don't have one
- **Rotate**: Regularly rotate your secret for security
- **Keep secure**: Never expose your secret in client-side code

**Important**: Keep your SSO secret secure! Rotate it regularly for security.

For detailed SSO integration instructions, see the [Widget SSO Integration Guide](/widget/guides/sso-integration).
