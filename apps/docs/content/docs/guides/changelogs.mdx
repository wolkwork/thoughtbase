## Overview

Changelogs keep your users informed about product updates and new features. They appear in the widget and on your public pages.

## Creating a New Changelog Entry

1. Go to **Changelog** in the sidebar
2. Click **New Entry**
3. Fill in the details:
   - **Title**: A clear, descriptive title
   - **Content**: Use the rich text editor to write your update
   - **Featured Image**: Upload an image to make your changelog stand out
   - **Link Ideas**: Connect completed ideas to this changelog entry
4. Choose when to publish:
   - **Draft**: Save for later editing
   - **Publish Now**: Make it immediately visible to users

## Writing Great Changelogs

### Content Tips

- **Write in a user-friendly tone**: Focus on benefits, not just technical details
- **Highlight value**: Explain how the update helps users
- **Use images**: Visual content makes changelogs more engaging
- **Be concise**: Get to the point quickly while providing enough detail

### Structure

A good changelog entry includes:
1. **Clear title**: What changed?
2. **Brief description**: Why does it matter?
3. **Visual content**: Image or screenshot if relevant
4. **Linked ideas**: Show which feedback led to this update

## Publishing Changelogs

### Draft vs Published

- **Draft status**: Only visible to your team in the dashboard
- **Published status**: Visible to users in the widget and public pages
- **Published date**: Set when the changelog should appear (can be scheduled for future dates)

### Publishing Process

1. Write your changelog entry
2. Review and edit as needed
3. Add a featured image (optional but recommended)
4. Link to completed ideas (if applicable)
5. Click **Publish** when ready

## Best Practices

### Frequency
