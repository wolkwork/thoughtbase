## Overview

Changelogs keep your users informed about product updates and new features. They appear in the widget and on your public pages.

## Creating a New Changelog Entry

Create changelog entries to share product updates with your users. Fill in the title, content, and optionally add a featured image and link to completed ideas.

## Writing Great Changelogs

- **Write in a user-friendly tone**: Focus on benefits, not just technical details
- **Use images**: Visual content makes changelogs more engaging
- **Link ideas**: Show which feedback led to this update

## Publishing Changelogs

### Draft vs Published

- **Draft status**: Only visible to your team in the dashboard
- **Published status**: Visible to users in the widget and public pages
- **Published date**: Set when the changelog should appear (can be scheduled for future dates)

## Editing and Managing

You can edit both draft and published entries. Changes to published entries are immediately visible.

## Best Practices

- **Regular updates**: Publish changelogs regularly to show active development
- **Batch updates**: Group related changes into single entries
- **Link to ideas**: Show users that you're listening to feedback
