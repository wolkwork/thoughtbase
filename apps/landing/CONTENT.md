# ThoughtBase – Feedback tools for product engineers

<div align="center">
  <h1>ThoughtBase</h1>
  <p><strong>The feedback backend for your product.</strong></p>
  <p>Collect feedback, prioritize roadmap, and ship changelogs without leaving your flow.</p>
</div>

## Drop-in installation

Paste this into your `layout.tsx` or `index.html`. It works with React, Vue, Svelte, and whatever framework you're rewriting your app in this week.

```html
<script
  src="https://cdn.thoughtbase.app/widget.js"
  data-id="YOUR_APP_ID"
></script>
```

## The Feedback OS

ThoughtBase isn't just "customer support software." It's a suite of tools built to help you ship the right things, faster.

### 1. Feedback Boards (Issues for Users)

Your users have ideas. Give them a place to dump them so they don't clog up your Discord or email.

- **Voting & Emojis:** Let users fight over what matters (so you don't have to guess).
- **Semantic Deduplication:** `Ctrl+F` for feature requests, automatically.
- **Internal & Private Boards:** For internal dogfooding or VIP customers.

### 2. Roadmap (Auto-sync)

Stop manually updating a Notion page that nobody looks at.

- **Status Sync:** Move a ticket to "Done", roadmap updates instantly.
- **Vote Visibility:** Show stakeholders _why_ you're building X instead of Y.

### 3. Changelog (Release Notes as Code)

Writing changelogs sucks. Let AI do it.

- **Auto-drafting:** We parse your shipped features and write the update.
- **Notifications:** We email everyone who voted for the thing you just shipped.
- **In-app Widget:** Users see the "New" badge and actually read what changed.

## Transparent pricing, no seat limits

We hate "per seat" pricing. It discourages you from adding your whole team. So we didn't do that.

| Plan        | Price        | Limits                                        |
| :---------- | :----------- | :-------------------------------------------- |
| **Hobby**   | **$0 / mo**  | Unlimited users, 2 boards, core features.     |
| **Starter** | **$29 / mo** | Custom domain, guest posting, private boards. |
| **Pro**     | **$59 / mo** | SSO, advanced search, unlimited everything.   |

_All plans include unlimited tracked users. Because charging for your customers is weird._

## Why ThoughtBase?

We're a little different from the enterprise behemoths (you know the ones).

1.  **Bootstrapped & Independent:** We don't have VCs breathing down our necks demanding 10x growth. We answer to you.
2.  **Built by Engineers:** We use ThoughtBase to build ThoughtBase. If it sucks, we fix it.
3.  **Speed:** The dashboard is fast. The widget is light. No loading spinners.

## Comparison

| Feature     | ThoughtBase                 | The "Enterprise" Standard |
| :---------- | :-------------------------- | :------------------------ |
| **Setup**   | 30 seconds (copy/paste)     | "Let's schedule a demo"   |
| **Pricing** | Flat rate (Unlimited users) | $$$ per seat              |
| **Design**  | Modern, clean               | Looks like Jira           |
| **Vibe**    | Indie / Builder             | Corporate / Sales-y       |

## Shameless CTA

If you're building a SaaS, you need feedback. You can build your own form, manage a spreadsheet, and manually email people... or you can just use ThoughtBase.
