Like, _really_ love it. The kind of love that makes you stay up way too late refactoring that one function that was perfectly fine but could be _just a little bit better_. The kind of love that makes you excited about a well-designed API endpoint. The kind of love that makes you think, \"You know what? We should build _our own_ feedback tool.\"\n\nYeah, we know. The feedback tool market is, to put it mildly, _saturated_. There are tools for every use case, every budget, every team size. You've got the enterprise behemoths, the scrappy startups, the open-source heroes, and everything in between. So why on earth would we create another one?\n\nWell, here's the thing: feedback tools are software. And we make software. A lot of it. And when you make a lot of software, you end up gathering a lot of feedback. User feedback, stakeholder feedback, internal feedback, feedback about the feedback process itself. It's feedback all the way down.\n\nWe found ourselves in this funny situation where we were building products that needed feedback mechanisms, and we were using other people's feedback tools to collect that feedback, and then we were getting feedback about those feedback tools. It was like a feedback inception situation, and somewhere in that recursive loop, we had a realization.\n\nWhat if we built a feedback tool that was exactly what _we_ needed? Not what a generic company needs, not what the market research says people want, but what _we_ want. What if we could make it the best tool for ourselves, and then share that with the world?\n\nThere's something beautiful about building tools for yourself. When you're your own customer, you have this great clarity about what matters to you and what doesn't. You don't need to guess what features will resonate. You know. You don't need to prioritize based on what might sell. You prioritize based on what will make your life better. And when you're building something that makes your own life better, you tend to build it really well.\n\nSo that's what we did. We built a feedback tool that we actually want to use. One that fits into our workflow like it was always meant to be there.\n\nAnd here's the kicker: we think other people might like it too. Not because we're special or unique, but because we're probably not that different from a lot of other teams out there. Teams that build software, gather feedback, and want tools that just work without getting in the way.\n\nWe're not trying to revolutionize the feedback industry or disrupt anything. We're just trying to build something we love using, and we're hoping you'll love using it too. Because at the end of the day, that's what software should be: something that makes your life a little bit better.\n\nSo here we are, in 2026, building a feedback tool.
